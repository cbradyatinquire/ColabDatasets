They seemed very thought out. ","I only played the Queen's module, so none that I saw. I did find it interesting that Brendan was addressing the Queen rather than the King though. ","The mouse/look around feature kept glitching on my computer. Sometimes my mouse would leave the playing screen and hit my normal computer screen, other times the mouse/look around feature just wouldn't work.","I loved that you could listen to the Anglo-Norman French pronunciation.

Introducing a sprint function (when double-tapping the W key) could significantly speed up gameplay.
